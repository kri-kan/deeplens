## 🔐 Authentication & Identity

DeepLens uses **NextGen.Identity** (based on Duende IdentityServer) as its centralized Identity Provider (IdP).

### Token Lifecycle
- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived JWTs (24 hours).
- **Refresh Tokens**: Long-lived 90-day tokens with sliding Refresh Token Rotation (RTR).
- **Detailed Specification**: See [Persistent Sessions & Token Architecture](../architecture/persistent-sessions-and-auth.md) for full token flow, mutexed retry queues, threat model, and cross-platform matrix.
- **Grant Types**: 
  - `password` / Direct API login (`POST /api/v1/auth/login`).
  - `authorization_code` (with PKCE) for Web UI / Identity server delegation.
  - `client_credentials` for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication.

### Token Claims
Every JWT issued by DeepLens contains:
- `sub`: Unique User ID.
- `tenant_id`: The ID of the primary tenant.
- `role`: The user's role (Admin, TenantOwner, User).
- `permissions`: Scoped permissions (e.g., `images:read`, `tenants:manage`).

## 🛡️ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

DeepLens implements a hierarchical RBAC model:

| Role             | Scope           | Permissions                                                    |
| :--------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Global Admin** | System-wide     | Manage all tenants, system-wide metrics, impersonate users.    |
| **Tenant Owner** | Tenant-specific | Manage tenant users, view tenant analytics, configure storage. |
| **User**         | Tenant-specific | Search images, upload images, manage own profile.              |

### Administrative Impersonation
System Admins can impersonate users for troubleshooting. 
- **Mechanism**: The backend generates a temporary context using the target user's ID but flags the request as `impersonated`.
- **Audit**: Every impersonated action is logged with both the Admin's ID and the target User's ID.

## 🚦 Rate Limiting & Protection

DeepLens protects its services via a multi-layered rate limiting strategy:

1.  **Global Limits (Gateway)**: Protects against DDoS and general service abuse based on IP.
2.  **Tenant-Based Limits**: Defined in the `tenants` table (e.g., `MaxApiCallsPerDay`).
3.  **Endpoint-Specific Limits**: Hardcoded or configured limits for expensive operations like `Search` or `Feature Extraction`.

### Tenant Tiers
- **Free**: 1,000 API calls/day, 1GB storage.
- **Professional**: 50,000 API calls/day, 100GB storage.
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits, dedicated infrastructure support.

## 📝 Security Best Practices

1.  **Transport Security**: All production traffic must use TLS 1.3.
2.  **Secret Management**: Developers should use Infisical or Azure Key Vault for secrets; Never commit `.env` files.
3.  **Data Isolation**: SQL queries must always include a `TenantId` filter to ensure data leakage does not occur.
4.  **Audit Logs**: All security-sensitive actions (login, deletions, RBAC changes) are captured in the platform audit log.
