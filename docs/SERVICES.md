## 🔄 Event Streaming (Apache Kafka)

Kafka acts as the backbone for the DeepLens image processing pipeline.

> **📖 For comprehensive Kafka documentation, see [KAFKA_TOPICS.md](./KAFKA_TOPICS.md)**

### Core Topics (Summary)
- `deeplens.images.uploaded`: Image upload notifications → triggers processing pipeline
- `deeplens.videos.uploaded`: Video upload notifications → triggers frame extraction
- `deeplens.features.extraction`: ML feature extraction requests → PythonService
- `deeplens.vectors.indexing`: Vector indexing requests → Qdrant
- `deeplens.processing.completed`: Pipeline completion notifications → SearchAPI
- `deeplens.processing.failed`: Error notifications → SearchAPI (triggers alerts/retry)
- `deeplens.images.maintenance`: Cleanup and maintenance tasks → MaintenanceWorker

### WhatsApp Processor Topic
- `whatsapp-ready-messages`: WhatsApp message queue → MessageQueueService

### Pipeline Flow
1. **Producer**: Search API (Upload / Merge)
2. **Consumer**: Image Processing Worker (Initializes pipeline)
3. **Consumer**: Feature Extraction Worker (Calls ML service)
4. **Consumer**: Vector Indexing Worker (Updates Qdrant)
5. **Consumer**: Image Maintenance Worker (Physical cleanup)

**See [KAFKA_TOPICS.md](./KAFKA_TOPICS.md) for detailed documentation including:**
- Complete data flow diagrams
- Payload examples for each topic
- Monitoring and management commands
- Best practices and troubleshooting

## 🖼️ Image & Thumbnail Handling

DeepLens manages large volumes of image data across multiple storage providers.

### Processing
- **Format**: All images are standardized to JPEG/PNG for feature extraction.
- **Thumbnails**:
  - Generated on-the-fly or background-cached.
  - Sizes: `Small (128x128)`, `Medium (512x512)`.
  - Storage: Stored in a dedicated `thumbnails` folder within the tenant's bucket.

## ☁️ Object Storage (MinIO / S3)

DeepLens uses a **Bucket-per-Tenant** strategy for object storage.

### Multi-Tenancy Strategy
- **Shared Instance**: Typically one MinIO instance serves many tenants for development.
- **Isolation**: Each tenant is restricted to their bucket via IAM policies.
- **BYOS**: Support for external endpoints (Azure Blob, AWS S3) allows enterprise tenants to keep their data in their own subscription.

## 🧪 OAuth 2.0 Testing Guide

To test authentication manually:

### 1. Client Credentials (M2M)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5198/connect/token \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -d "client_id=deeplens-m2m" \
  -d "client_secret=m2m-secret"
```

### 2. Authorization Code (Web UI)
Use the [OIDC Debugger](https://oidcdebugger.com/) or the built-in Swagger UI at `http://localhost:5198/swagger`.

### Common Scopes
- `openid`, `profile`, `deeplens.api.read`, `deeplens.api.write`.
